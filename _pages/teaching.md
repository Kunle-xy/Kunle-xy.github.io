## Teaching Assistant Experience

### Structural Health Monitoring Lab Course
**Iowa State University** | **Teaching Assistant** | **Fall 2023**

It was a great honor to teach a senior-level lab course, leading students through hands-on applications of structural health monitoring concepts. My responsibilities included:

- Instructing students in MATLAB for signal-processing tasks
- Guiding lab sessions focused on structural health monitoring techniques
- Enhancing student understanding of data acquisition and analysis in civil engineering

Special thanks to Professor Dr. Simon Laflamme for this opportunity to contribute to student learning and development.
