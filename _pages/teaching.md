#### Course Description

Introductory and advanced topics in structural health monitoring (SHM) of aeronautical, civil, and mechanical systems. Topics include:

- **Sensors** — Selection and deployment of sensing technologies
- **Signal Processing** — Time and frequency domain analysis techniques
- **Data Acquisition & Transmission** — System design and implementation
- **Integrated SHM Solutions** — Design of complete monitoring systems
- **Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE)** — Techniques for damage assessment without destructive testing
- **Feature Extraction Methods** — Identifying damage-sensitive indicators from sensor data
- **Cutting-Edge Research** — Current advances in the field of SHM

*Graduate students (5490) have a supervisory role to assist students in 4490, plus an additional design project or more in-depth analysis and design.*
