## Teaching Assistant Experience

### AerE 5490 / CE 5490: Structural Health Monitoring
**Iowa State University** | **Teaching Assistant** | **Fall 2023**

It was a great honor to serve as a Teaching Assistant for this senior/graduate-level course on Structural Health Monitoring, guiding students through both theoretical foundations and hands-on applications.

#### Course Information

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Course** | AerE 5490 / CE 5490 (Dual-listed with CE 4490) |
| **Credits** | 3 |
| **Contact Hours** | Lecture 3 |
| **Prerequisites** | Senior classification in an Engineering major or Permission of Instructor |
| **Instructor** | Professor Dr. Simon Laflamme |

#### Course Description

Introductory and advanced topics in structural health monitoring (SHM) of aeronautical, civil, and mechanical systems. Topics include:

- **Sensors** — Selection and deployment of sensing technologies
- **Signal Processing** — Time and frequency domain analysis techniques
- **Data Acquisition & Transmission** — System design and implementation
- **Integrated SHM Solutions** — Design of complete monitoring systems
- **Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE)** — Techniques for damage assessment without destructive testing
- **Feature Extraction Methods** — Identifying damage-sensitive indicators from sensor data
- **Cutting-Edge Research** — Current advances in the field of SHM

*Graduate students (5490) have a supervisory role to assist students in 4490, plus an additional design project or more in-depth analysis and design.*

#### My Responsibilities

As the Teaching Assistant, I was responsible for:

- **MATLAB Instruction** — Teaching students coding skills for signal processing tasks, including time-domain and frequency-domain analysis
- **Office Hours** — Holding regular office hours to provide one-on-one support and clarify course concepts
- **Student Support** — Answering student questions on assignments, lab work, and project implementations
- **Lab Sessions** — Guiding hands-on laboratory exercises focused on structural health monitoring techniques
- **Data Analysis Guidance** — Helping students understand data acquisition systems and analysis methods in civil and aerospace engineering contexts

## Educational Content Creation

### Ground Control Point (GCP) Mapping Tutorial Series

I created a **step-by-step video playlist** demonstrating the complete workflow for creating Ground Control Point maps—a critical tool in sUAS (small Unmanned Aircraft Systems) data collection campaigns.

#### Why GCPs Matter

Ground Control Points are essential for achieving high-precision georeferencing in drone-based photogrammetry and remote sensing. Proper GCP placement and retrieval directly impacts:

- **Positional accuracy** of orthomosaics and digital elevation models
- **Repeatability** of multi-temporal surveys for change detection
- **Survey-grade quality** required for infrastructure monitoring applications

#### Playlist Contents

The tutorial series covers:

1. **Planning GCP distribution** — Strategic placement for optimal coverage
2. **Field deployment procedures** — Best practices for placing GCPs before flights
3. **GPS/GNSS surveying** — Recording accurate coordinates for each control point
4. **Post-processing workflow** — Integrating GCPs into photogrammetry software
5. **Quality assessment** — Evaluating georeferencing accuracy and RMSE

#### Watch the Tutorial Series
