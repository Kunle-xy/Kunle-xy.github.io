## Bridging Engineering and AI

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Iowa State University dedicated to modernizing civil infrastructure management. My work sits at the intersection of Civil Engineering and Computer Science, where I apply advanced machine learning techniques to real-world problems.

### My Core Focus:

**Machine Learning & Computer Vision:** Leveraging deep learning and automated vision systems to identify infrastructure defects and patterns.

**sUAS Data Acquisition:** Piloting drones and executing flight missions for high-fidelity data collection.

**Big Data Analytics:** Turning noisy, unstructured data into clear, actionable insights for maintenance planning.

**Decision Support:** Empowering engineers to prioritize maintenance tasks effectively using data-driven models.

When I'm not coding or researching, I'm likely analyzing a chess game or watching soccer.
