## AI and Infrastructure Management

I am a PhD candidate at Iowa State University working at the intersection of Civil Engineering and Computer Science. My research centers on rethinking how infrastructure condition is assessed, shifting from labor intensive manual inspection toward data driven, AI enabled decision making. My academic work can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w1JdW5UAAAAJ&hl=en).
