I am thrilled to share some exciting news! I have been selected to receive the **GPSS Research Excellence Award** from the Graduate and Professional Student Senate at Iowa State University!

This year, the GPSS Awards Committee reviewed 75 complete nominations for the Research Excellence Award. Applications were evaluated based on the quality and rigor of scholarly work, evidence of research productivity, and demonstrated contribution to the advancement of knowledge within the discipline. I am incredibly grateful that my work was recognized among such a competitive pool of talented graduate researchers.

The award will be formally presented at the **GPSS Awards Ceremony** on **February 24, 2026**, from 6:00–8:00 PM in the South Ballroom, Memorial Union. I cannot wait to celebrate this milestone!
