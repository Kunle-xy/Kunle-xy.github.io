Excited to announce the publication of our peer-reviewed paper **"Maintenance Record-Enriched Machine Learning Model for Pavement International Roughness Index Prediction"** in the International Journal of Pavement Engineering!

This research integrates maintenance textual data with numerical predictors for pavement performance forecasting, using a customized neural network to encode maintenance information and merge it with traditional field measurements.

#### Key Contributions

- Enables single-model application across a pavement's entire service life
- Handles multiple concurrent maintenance activities with improved accuracy
- Bridges the gap between textual maintenance records and numerical performance prediction

#### Research Visualizations
