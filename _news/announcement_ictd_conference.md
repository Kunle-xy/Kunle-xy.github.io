Incredible learning experience at the **ASCE ICTD-Pavement 2025 conference**, where I presented research on applying AI and drone technology to pavement infrastructure challenges through the PROSPER program!

#### Published and Presented Two Studies

1. **"Low-Altitude sUAS Flights for Remote Sensing of Submillimeter Hairline Cracks: A Case Study"**
   - Focused on drone technology for detecting hairline cracks in pavement

2. **"Automatic Pavement Maintenance Predictions Using Language and Machine Learning Models"**
   - Applied transformer models and textual knowledge integration for analyzing pavement performance
